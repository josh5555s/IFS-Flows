# S1: Getting to Know a Protector

## P0: Choosing Focus Protector
1. If you know which part is causing an issue, choose it.
2. Become aware of which parts are activated at the moment, and sense which one most needs your attention.
3. If you have a challenging situation, describe the situation, including your thoughts and feelings that it evokes, then list which parts are having those thoughts and feelings, and choose the one that seems to need your help most. See the [Situation Session Flow](./_ifs-situation-flow.md) for a more detailed walk-through.

## P1: Accessing Focus Protector
*If the part is not activated, imagine yourself in a situation when you know the part gets activated*
- Notice the quality of the protector's sensation in your body. 
  - Where is the sensation located?
  - Does it have a color?
- What emotion is the part feeling?
- Get an image of the part. 
  - If you don’t get an image, try focusing on the part's sensation in the body and see if an image comes from that attunement.
- What is the part saying to you or to the world?

## P2: Unblending From Focus Protector
- How do you feel toward the part? Are you in relation to it, or are you it?
  - check for separation
- Check to see if you are charged up with the part’s feelings.
- Check to see if you are caught up in the part’s beliefs.
- **If you are blended with the target part, options for un-blending:**
  - Ask the part to make space for you to be there, too, or separate from you, so you can get to know it
  - Move back to separate from the part
  - Visualize the part as very small and Self as very large
  - Get an image of the part at a distance from you
  - Do a short centering/grounding meditation. 
  - Draw the part
- If the part doesn’t separate, ask what it is afraid would happen if it did separate?
Explain to it the value of separating or reassure it about its fears

## P3. Unblending From Concerned Parts(s)
- How do you feel toward the part?
- If you feel compassionate, curious, etc., then you are in Self, move on to P4.
- If you don’t, then unblend from the concerned part:
  - Ask the concerned part if it would be willing to step aside (or relax) just for now so you can get to know the target part from an open place
  - If it does, then check again to see how you feel toward the target part, and repeat
  - If it isn’t willing to step aside, explain to it the value of stepping aside 
  - If it still won’t, ask it what it is afraid would happen if it did and reassure it about its fears
  - If it still won’t, make the concerned part the target part and work with it

## P4. Learning About Focus Protector
*Remember that the part may answer in words, images, body sensations, emotions, or direct knowing.*
- Invite the part to tell you about itself.
- What are you concerned about?
- What do you feel? What makes you feel that?
- What do you hope to accomplish by doing your role?
- What are you afraid would happen if you didn’t do your role? 
  - how do you feel to it's response?
- What are your origins?

The question, “What are you afraid would happen if you didn’t do your role” also points to the exile.
